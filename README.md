# Home-Security-System

The aim of this project is to use Raspberry pi to remotely monitor the house using a camera feed and host the feed on the web for remote access. Another aspect of this project is to present the idea of monitoring and tracking an intruder through the use of a camera. Any object passing through the field of view of the camera will be detected and then tracked. The system would activate a camera to take frames of video, detect the presence of an intruder and send an alert to the house owner through telegram along with the image of the intruder as well as stream the video feed on a web server. The alert message is also logged in firebase and ThingSpeak for future reference. OpenCV is used to turn on the camera as well as capture images and process them.
